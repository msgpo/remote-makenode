# Setup

You may have to generate a key pair with `dropbearkey` if you do not already have one.

Create settings.sh from template and edit to taste:

```
cp settings.sh.example settings.sh
```

The server's public key should be located in `keys/server.pub` and should be in the format used by openssh.
